#Summary: Serge's quest requires players to hunt slimes and gather 1 Forest Slime Core and 10 Drips of Slime in exchange for a Plant Slime.  
#Drips of Slime should be uncommon (maybe at the same rate as rags?) drops from any slime monster in the game
#Forest Slime Core should be very rare drops from Forest Slimes only
